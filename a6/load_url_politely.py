	This is a function to do webscraping as politely as possible
	What does that mean?

	We check to see if we have requested anything 
	from this site in the past N seconds
	so that we don't overwhelm the site with requests 
	because we have a runaway loop (accidental DDS attack)

	When we request a site, we make a local "cached copy"
	and if we have a cached copy, we use that instead of asking the server.

	Caching is a super-important practical part of programming 
	that we don't often talk about in CS! 

	"Caching" means that rather than always requesting a resource, 
	we keep a local copy and only update that copy when 
	we think its out of date (cache invalidation)
